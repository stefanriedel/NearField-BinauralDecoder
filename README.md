# NearField-BinauralDecoder
In this repo you can find mcfx-convolver presets for Ambisonic Binaural Decoders that are able to render near-field sources. The decoders are based on BRIRs (Binaural Room Impulse Responses) and are loaded as filters to the mcfx convolver plug-in by Matthias Kronlachner.
